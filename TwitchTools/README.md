# Twitch Tools Playlist Generator

[Twitch Tools][TT] is “a third party website that provides tools for
[Twitch][].” One of its features is a video downloader that will find the
URLs to the video files stored on the Twitch servers. You can use these
URLs to watch Twitch content in your own media player, maybe because you
are on a platform that doesn’t support Twitch’s online player.

This user script generates a downloadable [M3U][] playlist to easily load
all the different parts of a stream into your media player in one go.
