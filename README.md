A Collection of User Scripts
============================

This repository includes a number of user scripts (JavaScript files that
the browser runs on a website) created by me for my day-to-day internet
browsing.

All code in this repository is licensed under the MIT licence, included in
the root, unless otherwise noted.

## User scripts

1. [Twitch Tools Playlist Generator](TwitchTools).

## JSLint

Every JavaScript file is linted before being published. The `package.json`
file in this repository makes sure JSLint is available in the easiest way
possible. Run `npm install` to install
[node-jslint](https://github.com/reid/node-jslint), then `npm test` to run
it against the user scripts.
